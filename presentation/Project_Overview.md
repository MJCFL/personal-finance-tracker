**Backend:**
- Next.js API Routes
- MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)
- NextAuth.js (authentication)

**Security:**
- Google OAuth for secure authentication
- Environment variables for sensitive information
- HTTP security headers
- Protected API routes

**Deployment:**
- Vercel-ready configuration
- MongoDB Atlas cloud database
